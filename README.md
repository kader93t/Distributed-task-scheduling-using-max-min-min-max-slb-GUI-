# Distributed Task scheduling using Max-min, Min-max and Slb algorithms (GUI)
Simulate a distributed task scheduling using max-min min-max slb algorithms and compare between them.



#### This project is created using Java.

#### The entry is a table : 

- Machines in the rows
- Tasks in the columns 
- The intersection between the row (A) and the column (Y) is the time that will take the machine (A) to complet The task (Y).

## Features

- Import a file or create your own table using the interface
- Lunch the three algrimthes togather and compare between theme 
- Relunch the calcul using the precedent state (the previous result)


##### The project includ some test files in the directory " test_files " that you can use to test the tool
